Bugs/API inconsistencies
- Shelly 1: the device doesn't response to http requests when
  an auto timer for ON/OFF is configured
  the action urls are set and
  the relay output is set to IN ON via the API
  then the device stops responding to http requests for 5-15s
- Shelly 2.5: scenario like the one before
  when pressing both buttons events gets issues, 
  but device stops responding to http requests for 5-15sec
- Shelly1: After updating to FW 20190711-084053/v1.5.0-hotfix4@3b4f7414
  the API returns "update":{"status":"unknown","has_update":false,"new_version":"","old_version":"20190711-084053/v1.5.0-hotfix4@3b4f7414"}
  (worked fine with previous fw versions)
- Shelly1: Coap device description is not filled properly
- ShellyHT: Sends CoIoT status updates with duplicate sertial, but new sensor values

Documentation
- The Shelly Bulb API is not described clearly and maybe it is inconsistent - e.g. it describes /light whereas the Web UI uses /color and /white
- The CoIoT documetation should be significantly improved. Ut was hard to inmplement, e.g.
  it's not mentioned that you need to subscribe to a multicast group to receive the status udates
  the calculation of validity needs to be better explainedc

 
 Feature Requests
  - Event Callback (http+coap) when settings have been modified. This avoid polling to get notified by changes made by another App.
  - total value should be stored in EEPROM + a command to reset it. This gives the user the control when to reset the accumulation and continue after a power outage.
  - Roller: more granular updates on roller position (e.g. every 3s while moving the roller) - http status + coap
  
  Review:
  - The usage of non-standard COAP options and codes makes if difficult to implement and could be a blocker when using standard frameworks like Californium. This is a big hurdle to make a quick start.
