# Shelly binding for openHAB V2

This binding implements control and monitoring for the Shelly serries of devices.

The binding is still under development. If you want to become a beta tester switch to the lastest branch.
Status: Most devices are supported, but new versions could still change the channel structure, so I keep the build in alpha mode.
